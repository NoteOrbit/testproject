The values entered are lost when the function returns and the contents of c in the display function are indeterminate producing undefined behavior (garbage output).
The program may seem to behave as expected if, by chance, the position and contents of the c array in both functions happens to be the same.
You should more the definition of the array to the main function and pass it to data_entry_of_customers() and display().
Here is a modified version:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

typedef struct Customer {
    char name[20];
    int date;
    int month;
    int year;
    int amount;
    int type_of_account;
} cus;

void display(int n, cus c[n]);
void data_entry_of_customers(int n, cus c[n]);

int main() {
    int n, choices;

    printf(""\n Enter the number of customers : "");
    if (scanf(""%d"", &n) != 1)
        return 1;
    cus cus_array[n];

    for (;;) {
        printf(""\n Enter your choice :"");
        if (scanf(""%d"", &choices) != 1)

        switch (choices) {
        case 1:
            data_entry_of_customers(n, cus_array);
            break;

        case 2:
            display(n, cus_array);
            break;

        case 3:
            return 0;

        default:
            printf(""\n Invalid Choice\n"");
            break;
        }
    }
    return 0;
}

void data_entry_of_customers(int n, cus c[n]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf(""\n Enter the name of the customer%d : "", i + 1);
        scanf(""%19s"", c[i].name);
        printf(""\n Enter the date when the account was opened by customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].date);
        printf(""\n Enter the month when the account was opened by customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].month);
        printf(""\n Enter the year when the account was opened by customer : "");
        scanf(""%d"", &c[i].year);
        printf(""\n Enter the amount deposited by the customer : "");

    }
}

void display(int n, cus c[n]) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        printf(""\n The name of the customer%d is %s"", i + 1, c[i].name);
        printf(""\n The date-month-year when the account was opened by customer%d is %d-%d-%d"", i + 1, c[i].date, c[i].month, c[i].year);
        printf(""\n The amount when the account was opened by customer%d is %d"", i + 1, c[i].amount);
        printf(""\n"");
    }
}
Note these remarks:
void display(int n, cus c[n]); defines a function that receives an int and a pointer to an array of cus structures. The prototype is equivalent to: void display(int n, cus c[]); and void display(int n, cus *c);... A possible improvement is to specify that the cus structures are not modified by the display function, thus change the prototype to void display(int n, const cus *c);
the return value of scanf should be tested to detect and handle invalid input. Writing separate functions to read a string and an integer would help make the code more reliable and readable.
Here is an alternate approach:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

Since you're filtering on multiple elements, this pattern isn't going to work either. You'll need to save all of your filters so you can remove one but keep the others when the box is unchecked. I like to use a Set for this purpose. You can then just filter the products on that set.
You also don't need to use state variables for constants that don't change.
Also, your ids and htmlFors need to be unique, or clicking on a label will always select the first box. It's simpler just to wrap the input with the label so you don't need to worry about it.

25,74585222,74584926,John Li,20436957,"Here is a minimal solution works without useEffect or changing category and products.
A few issues that can be addressed in posted code:
Each input need to have an unique id which matches htmlFor on label for the pair to work together.
When filterProducts sets a new state value, it does not get the updated value in the same block. Only use this event to set the filters in toCheck.
The value type of toCheck can be an object of [category]: Boolean so each category can be filtered separately, and filters can be combined as well.
The original products can be filtered before mapped, so there is no need to keep another state of newProducts, or to modify products data.

The test for spinner should be like that:
render the component
find the email input field and ""type"" there an email - use one of getBy* methods and then type with e.g. fireEvent.change(input, {target: {value: 'test@example.com'}})
find the password input field and ""type"" there a password - same as above
find the submit button and ""click"" it - use one of getBy* methods to find it and then use fireEvent to click it
this (I assume) should trigger your onSubmit which will call the handleLogin callback which will update the state and that will render the spinner.
check if spinner is in the document.

Rewrite to avoid Nz:

37,74588843,74584967,Gustav,3527297,"First, Access might think that the subquery may return more than one record, thus Top 1 should be used.
Next, it makes no sense to order the records to be inserted, as records per definition carries no order unless you specify this in the target table or the query where that table is used as source.
Also, even if you insisted to sort the insert, Access can't do this, as it doesn't know the output for AM.
Thus, this will run:
sSQL = ""SELECT tApplicant.applicationID, tApplicant.name, tApplicant.ID, tPreferences.fld3, "" & _
       ""NZ((SELECT Top 1 1 FROM tInfo WHERE tInfo.applicationID = tApplicant.applicationID), 0) AS AM "" _

       ""WHERE tPreferences.IDposit = "" & rsRos!ID & "";""

That said, Erik's suggestion to replace Nz with Exists is preferable as this will result in ""clean SQL"" which always will run faster:
sSQL = ""SELECT tApplicant.applicationID, tApplicant.name, tApplicant.ID, tPreferences.fld3, "" & _
       ""EXISTS (SELECT Top 1 1 FROM tInfo WHERE tInfo.applicationID = tApplicant.applicationID) AS AM "" _

Neither will this be sortable on AM. Also, it will in Access SQL return -1 and 0 for AM. To obtain 1, apply ABS:

}
Note these remarks:
void display(int n, cus c[n]); defines a function that receives an int and a pointer to an array of cus structures. The prototype is equivalent to: void display(int n, cus c[]); and void display(int n, cus *c);... A possible improvement is to specify that the cus structures are not modified by the display function, thus change the prototype to void display(int n, const cus *c);
the return value of scanf should be tested to detect and handle invalid input. Writing separate functions to read a string and an integer would help make the code more reliable and readable.

Since you're filtering on multiple elements, this pattern isn't going to work either. You'll need to save all of your filters so you can remove one but keep the others when the box is unchecked. I like to use a Set for this purpose. You can then just filter the products on that set.
You also don't need to use state variables for constants that don't change.
Also, your ids and htmlFors need to be unique, or clicking on a label will always select the first box. It's simpler just to wrap the input with the label so you don't need to worry about it.

66,74585222,74584926,John Li,20436957,"Here is a minimal solution works without useEffect or changing category and products.
A few issues that can be addressed in posted code:
Each input need to have an unique id which matches htmlFor on label for the pair to work together.
When filterProducts sets a new state value, it does not get the updated value in the same block. Only use this event to set the filters in toCheck.
The value type of toCheck can be an object of [category]: Boolean so each category can be filtered separately, and filters can be combined as well.
The original products can be filtered before mapped, so there is no need to keep another state of newProducts, or to modify products data.

82,74594134,74584892,chiliNUT,2079345,"I'll take a stab at this. Assuming I'm interpreting the spec's rules correctly (which I may not be) the section on how to handle error handling when parsing css would seem to allow for this.
a.) In The DOM standard for querySelector
The querySelector(selectors) method steps are to return the first result of running scope-match a selectors string selectors against this, if the result is not an empty list; otherwise null.
https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#dom-parentnode-queryselector
b. ) That links to section 1.3. Selectors. Looking at section 1.3.1:
To scope-match a selectors string selectors against a node, run these steps:
Let s be the result of parse a selector selectors. [SELECTORS4]
c.) Parse a selector links off to the csswg v4 draft, which doesn't go into as much detail about error handling as the v3 draft. The v3 draft states (emphasis added by me):
§ 2.2. Error Handling
This section is not normative.
When errors occur in CSS, the parser attempts to recover gracefully, throwing away only the minimum amount of content before returning to parsing as normal. This is because errors aren’t always mistakes—new syntax looks like an error to an old parser, and it’s useful to be able to add new syntax to the language without worrying about stylesheets that include it being completely broken in older UAs.
The precise error-recovery behavior is detailed in the parser itself, but it’s simple enough that a short description is fairly accurate.
At the ""top level"" of a stylesheet, an starts an at-rule. Anything else starts a qualified rule, and is included in the rule’s prelude. This may produce an invalid selector, but that’s not the concern of the CSS parser—at worst, it means the selector will match nothing.
Once an at-rule starts, nothing is invalid from the parser’s standpoint; it’s all part of the at-rule’s prelude. Encountering a ends the at-rule immediately, while encountering an opening curly-brace <{-token> starts the at-rule’s body. The at-rule seeks forward, matching blocks (content surrounded by (), {}, or []) until it finds a closing curly-brace <}-token> that isn’t matched by anything else or inside of another block. The contents of the at-rule are then interpreted according to the at-rule’s own grammar.
Qualified rules work similarly, except that semicolons don’t end them; instead, they are just taken in as part of the rule’s prelude. When the first {} block is found, the contents are always interpreted as a list of declarations.
When interpreting a list of declarations, unknown syntax at any point causes the parser to throw away whatever declaration it’s currently building, and seek forward until it finds a semicolon (or the end of the block). It then starts fresh, trying to parse a declaration again.
If the stylesheet ends while any rule, declaration, function, string, etc. are still open, everything is automatically closed. This doesn’t make them invalid, though they may be incomplete and thus thrown away when they are verified against their grammar.
After each construct (declaration, style rule, at-rule) is parsed, the user agent checks it against its expected grammar. If it does not match the grammar, it’s invalid, and gets ignored by the UA, which treats it as if it wasn’t there at all.
https://drafts.csswg.org/css-syntax-3/#error-handling
Bullets 3-5 allow for a css rule to end without proper closing delimiters. In a stylesheet, a rule is a ""prelude"" (selector) followed by a set of css declarations wrapped in braces. A selector with no rules after it is invalid and discarded.
<style>
div[foo]
</style>
and is treated the same as a selector without a proper closing delimiter
<style>
div[foo
</style>
A selector with rules after it missing a closing ; and/or } is a complete selector + rule, and so it is still valid. Both of these are valid:
<style>
.foo {
    color:red;
</style>
or
<style>
.bar {
    color:blue
</style>
Finally, given that document.querySelector only requires a selector with no rule following it, I would conclude that a selector with a missing closing delimiter is valid according to the spec. You can see the same behavior with the :is pseudo class selector:
document.querySelector(""div:is(.foo"");
document.querySelector(""div:is([foo"");",2022-11-27 22:17:30Z,4

Edit: managing RAM requirements
One way that we can manage RAM requirements (for this, or any other algorithm on large datasets) is to find ways to divide-and-conquer.
If we look at our particular problem, each line in the input dataset leads to results that are independent of any other line. We can use this fact to apply our algorithm in batches.
But first, let's create some data that leads to a large problem:
min_time = 0
max_time = 1_000
nbr_groups = 400_000
min_df = (
    pl.DataFrame({""time_idx"": [list(range(min_time, max_time, 2))]})
    .join(
        pl.arange(0, nbr_groups, eager=True).alias(""group_idx"").to_frame(),
        how=""cross""
    )
)
min_df.explode('time_idx')

The input dataset when exploded is 200 million records .. so roughly the size you describe. (Of course, using divide-and-conquer, we won't explode the full dataset.)
To divide-and-conquer this, we'll slice our input dataset into smaller datasets, run the algorithm on the smaller datasets, and then concat the results into one large dataset. (One nice feature of slice is that it's very cheap - it's simply a window into the original dataset, so it consumes very little additional RAM.)
Notice the slice_size variable. You'll need to experiment with this value on your particular computing platform. You want to set this as large as your RAM requirements allow. If set too low, your program will take too long. If set too high, your program will crash. (I've arbitrarily set this to 10,000 as a starting value.)

Some other things
You do actually need to use the joins. The joins are used to fill in the ""holes"" in your sequences with null values.
Also, notice that I've put each slice/batch into lazy mode, but not the entire algorithm. Depending on your computing platform, using lazy mode for the entire algorithm may again overwhelm your system, as Polars attempts to spread the work across multiple processors which could lead to more out-of-memory situations for you.
Also note the humongous size of my output dataset: almost 400 million records. I did this purposely as a reminder that your output dataset may be the ultimate problem. That is, any algorithm would fail if the result dataset is larger than your RAM can hold.",2022-11-27 21:00:06Z,2

You can unnest([ ... ] subsequence) to do the explode in duckdb - it seems to be a bit slower currently.

91,74585399,74584886,hpaulj,901925,"If you are too lazy, or ignorant, to do are ""proper"" 'vectorization', you can use np.vectorize. But you need to take time to really read its docs. It isn't magic. It can be useful, especially if you need to take advantage of broadcasting, and the function, some reason or other, only accepts scalars.
Rewriting your function to work with scalar inputs (though it also works fine with arrays, in this case):
In [91]: def foo(x,y): return x+y
    ...: f = np.vectorize(foo)
With scalar inputs:
In [92]: f(1,2)
Out[92]: array(3)
With 2 arrays (a (2,1) and (3,)), returning a (2,3):
In [93]: f(np.array([1,2])[:,None], np.arange(1,4))
Out[93]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
Samething with meshgrid:
In [94]: I,J = np.meshgrid(np.array([1,2]), np.arange(1,4),indexing='ij')

In [95]: I
Out[95]: 
array([[1, 1, 1],
       [2, 2, 2]])

In [96]: J
Out[96]: 
array([[1, 2, 3],
       [1, 2, 3]])

In [97]: f(I,J)
Out[97]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
Or meshgrid arrays as defined in [93]:
In [98]: I,J = np.meshgrid(np.array([1,2]), np.arange(1,4),indexing='ij', sparse=True)

In [99]: I,J
Out[99]: 
(array([[1],
        [2]]),
 array([[1, 2, 3]]))
But in a true vectorized sense, you can just add the 2 arrays:
In [100]: I+J
Out[100]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
The first paragraph of np.vectorize docs (my emphasis):
Define a vectorized function which takes a nested sequence of objects or numpy arrays as inputs and returns a single numpy array or a tuple of numpy arrays. The vectorized function evaluates pyfunc over successive tuples of the input arrays like the python map function, except it uses the broadcasting rules of numpy.
edit
Starting with a function that expects a 2 element tuple, we could add a cover that splits it into two, and apply vectorize to that:
In [103]: def foo1(x): return x[0]+x[1]
     ...: def foo2(x,y): return foo1((x,y))
     ...: f = np.vectorize(foo2)

In [104]: f(1,2)
Out[104]: array(3)
X is a 2d element tuple:
In [105]: X = np.meshgrid(np.array([1,2]), np.arange(1,4),indexing='ij')

In [106]: X
Out[106]: 
[array([[1, 1, 1],
        [2, 2, 2]]),
 array([[1, 2, 3],
        [1, 2, 3]])]
which can be passed to f as:
In [107]: f(X[0],X[1])
Out[107]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
But there's no need to slow things down with that iteration. Just pass the tuple to foo1:
In [108]: foo1(X)
Out[108]: 
array([[2, 3, 4],
       [3, 4, 5]])
In f = lambda x: x[0] + x[1] if x[0] > 0 else 0 you get the 'ambiguity' valueerror because if only works with scalars. But there are plenty of faster numpy ways of replacing such an if step.",2022-11-26 22:16:21Z,0

135,74584908,74584859,matt,341994,"Basically this is the same as the question I answer here.
Foundation is not part of Swift, it's part of Cocoa, the older Objective-C library that preceded Swift by many, many years. Foundation's version of a string is NSString. But Swift String is ""bridged"" to NSString, so as soon as you import Foundation, a bunch of NSString methods spring to life as if they were part of Swift String even though they are not. In your case, you actually end up calling a completely different method which, as you've discovered, gives different results.
A good way to see this is to command-click on the term contains in your code (or even better, option-click it and then click Open in Developer Documentation):
If you have not imported Foundation (or UIKit), you jump to Swift String's contains.
If you have imported Foundation, you jump to Foundation's contains.
As for this part:
shouldn't the language indicate this somehow
I'm afraid Stack Overflow is not very good on ""should"" questions. I would say, yes, this is a little maddening, but it's part of the price we pay for the easy and seamless integration of Swift into the world of Cocoa programming. You could argue that the Swift people should not have named their method contains, but that train has left the station, and besides, it's a name that perfectly indicates what the method does.
Another thing to keep in mind is that you would probably never really use Swift except in the presence of Foundation (perhaps because you're in the presence of UIKit or SwiftUI or AppKit) so in practical terms the issue wouldn't arise. You've hit an unusual edge-case, which is commendable but, ex hypothesi, unusual.
To make things even more complicated, I think the Swift library method you encountered may have been just introduced as part of Xcode 14 and Swift 5.7 etc. See https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/110354/?time=1415 for the WWDC '22 discussion of new String features. In earlier versions of Xcode, the phrase ""a"".contains("""") would not even have compiled in the absence of Foundation — and so the problem would never have arisen!",2022-11-26 19:43:39Z,8

142,74586489,74584847,Ethan,6797953,"I think the problem is that only one of your data files gives a specific date.
If you read in time data using format ""%H:%M:%S"" (no year/date given) then the times are assumed to be relative to the epoch date 1-Jan-1970. So those data points come out 52 years off from the 2022 data points.
Option 1:
If all the data points in both files are from the same day, then I suggest the easiest thing to do is skip the date information in the file where it is present. I.e.
set timefmt ""%H:%M:%S""
set xrange [""17:20:00"":""18:47:00""]
plot 'xxx.csv' using (timecolumn(2, ""2022-11-24 %H:%M:%S"")):4 title ""aaa"" \
     'yyy.csv' using (timecolumn(1, ""%H:%M:%S"")):2 title ""bbb""
The string ""2022-11-24"" must match on input for the first file but it doesn't actually contribute to the date calculation.
Option 2:
If you really do care about the date, or if the first file spans multiple dates so that a constant string cannot match, then you could instead add a date component to the time string in the second file by concatenating a string constant containing the date.
myfmt = ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S""
set timefmt ""%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S""
set xrange [""2022-11-24 17:20:00"":""2022-11-24 18:47:00""]

I believe you're trying to call a setKey method that is inside a Graph class from a forEach loop, correct? As I don't have the entire context, I tried to simplify the code and check if that works for you:
class Graph {
    constructor() {}

Since you mentioned bash, to get what you wanted, you need to read the section of the bash man page for printf more closely.
The round brackets are used in AWK, C, others. Bash shows no mention of round brackets in the usage syntax. However, you need to add a ""format"" specifier (NOT same as AWK), but per the man page.
Your statement should be reworked to show as this:
printf ""%b\n"" ""\033[35m\033[K"" ""hello world"" ""\033[m\033[K""
OR ... you could just replace the printf ""%b\n"" with simply echo -e to get the same result.

Player9 wins with 90 points

and there is no space in the first line of the file, because you have text_file.write(""\n"") written in the first line. Please add it at the end of the line, i.e the last file write.
For example:
text_file.write(name)
text_file.write ("" wins with "")
text_file.write (score)
text_file.write ("" points"")
text_file.write(""\n"")
Here is how to get the 5 highest scores of the file:
text_file = open('CH30.txt.', 'r')
Lines = text_file.readlines()
PlayersScores = []

# read each line get the player name and points 
for line in Lines:
    # split the line into list of strings

    # removing \n from last element
    line[-1] = line[-1].replace(""\n"", """")
    print(line)
    # find player name position
    playerName = line.index(""wins"") - 1
    # find points position
    points = line.index(""points"") - 1
    # add the tuple (playerName, points) in a list
    PlayersScores.append((line[playerName], line[points]))
# descending order sort by player score
PlayersScores = sorted(PlayersScores, key=lambda t: t[1], reverse=True)

print(""Highest Scores:\n"")
for i in range(5):
    print(str(i+1) + "". "" + PlayersScores[i][0] + "" "" + PlayersScores[i][1] + "" points"")
Output example:

1. Player11 120 points
2. Player9 90 points
3. Player3 85 points
4. Player6 80 points
5. Player8 70 points",2022-11-27 08:23:53Z,1

How to read a file line-by-line into a list?

""Rick wins with 98 points""
Sorting function would look like this:
scores.sort(key= lambda x : int(x.split("" "")[3]))
Then, you just need to slice the last five elements.
Please note, this solution is prone to many errors, as you use the file in human-readable format. What's easily readable for us, is often hard to read by computer (and vice versa).

Next, Get-ADGroupMember will not just return computer objects, but also users and other groups can be members of one particular group. Therefore, if you want to get output for computer objects only, you will need to filter out the other object types.
Luckily, each group member has a property called objectClass. This is a string containing either 'user', 'computer' or 'group', so it is realy quite easy to check on that:
# get all members of the group, filter with a Where-Object clause to receive only computer objects
$members = Get-ADGroupMember -Identity ""Groupname"" | Where-Object {$_.objectClass -eq 'computer'}

logic:
caret ^ is not supported by QUERY so we first transform ^2 into an alternative. we know x^2 is equal to x*x so we extract that 2 and subtract 1 and REPT *x one time
next, we need to add multiplication as ()() needs to become ()*() same as 50x to 50*x
then we substitute x with value and evaluate the string with QUERY's SQL ## logic:
basically, we transform your:
-50(x)-1/2(-9.81)(x^2)+35
into:
-50*(0)-1/2*(-9.81)*(0*0)+35
-50*(1)-1/2*(-9.81)*(1*1)+35
-50*(2)-1/2*(-9.81)*(2*2)+35
etc.
UPDATE:
x^n where n is <1 are unachievable with REPT method and QUERY does not support roots so we can use a script to convert a text string into the formula
poor script example:
function onEdit(){
  var sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSheet();
  var source1= sheet.getRange('F7');

  var formula1 = source1.getValue();

185,70763406,70745701,jcalz,2887218,"The issue here is that you have a value of union type (Section | Link)[] | [] and you're trying to call its filter() method, which is therefore also a union of function types. Taking a union of functions with differing call signatures and deciding which calls are safe is not a trivial task. Conceptually a union of call signatures should take an intersection of the parameters (due to contravariance of function/method parameters), but there are a lot of practical issues that make it harder.
Originally, TypeScript just gave up and didn't let you call such functions at all. See microsoft/TypeScript#7294. Then TypeScript 3.3 introduced support for calling some union types via a fix in microsoft/TypeScript#29011, which would synthesize a single call signature using the intersections of the parameters from the individual union members' call signatures, as long as no more than one member's call signature is overloaded and no more than one member's call signature is a generic. This improved things a lot, but in particular array methods tend to be generic and/or overloaded so unions of arrays still had few useful methods available. See microsoft/TypeScript#36390. A little more work has been done in microsoft/TypeScript#31023 to allow some generic methods to be called in unions, and as of now, only reduce() is completely uncallable for unions of functions. Still, it's not perfect, and microsoft/TypeScript#44373 is the currently open issue about this. Your filter() call is specifically trying to use the overloads where the callback is a user-defined type guard function, and that's just not supported at this time.
So for now there are only workarounds. My go-to workaround:
Generally speaking when you have an array of type Array<A> | Array<B> and you're only going to be reading from it, it should be safe to treat it as a value of type ReadonlyArray<A | B>. In fact, the compiler will generally let you perform this widening:
parentSection.children; //  (Section | Link)[] | []
const pc: readonly (Section | Link)[] = parentSection.children; // no error
Note that the element type for [] is the never type, so ReadonlyArray<A | B> in this case would be ReadonlyArray<(Section | Link) | never> which is just ReadonlyArray<Section | Link>.
Once you have a ReadonlyArray<A | B>, it's no longer a union type (its elements are union typed but not the array itself) and you can call filter() with impunity:
const sections = pc.filter((item): item is Section => !!item && item.type === 'section');
// const sections: Section[]
Note that you could shorten this to a one-liner:
const sections = (parentSection.children as readonly (Section | Link)[]).
  filter((item): item is Section => !!item && item.type === 'section');
// const sections: Section[]
but that's a bit less type safe since type assertions allow (unsafe) narrowing/downcasting as well as (safe) widening/upcasting, whereas type annotations on variables only allows widening/upcasting.
There are, of course, other viable workarounds (e.g., you mentioned using map(x => x), which works because of some of the above PRs, and then it becomes a single array type). Until and unless microsoft/TypeScript#44373 is addressed, you'll have to stick with your favorite workaround.

This looks like a fundamental deficiency in flex layout.
A flex container in column-direction will not expand to accommodate additional columns. (This is not a problem in flex-direction: row.)
This question has been asked many times (see list below), with no clean answers in CSS.
It's hard to pin this as a bug because the problem occurs across all major browsers. But it does raise the question:
How is it possible that all major browsers got the flex container to expand on wrap in row-direction but not in column-direction?
You would think at least one of them would get it right. I can only speculate on the reason. Maybe it was a technically difficult implementation and was shelved for this iteration.
UPDATE: The issue appears to be resolved in Edge v16.
Illustration of the Problem
The OP created a useful demo illustrating the problem. I'm copying it here: http://jsfiddle.net/nwccdwLw/1/

Hacky solutions from the Stack Overflow community:
""It seems this issue cannot be solved only with CSS, so I propose you a JQuery solution.""
""It's curious that most browsers haven't implemented column flex containers correctly, but the support for writing modes is reasonably good. Therefore, you can use a row flex container with a vertical writing mode.""

Instead of separating the layout into 3 different divs, I'm adding all the items into 1 div and creating the separation with some more divs in between.
The proposed solution is hard coded, assuming we have 3 sections, but can be extended to a generic one. The main idea is to explain how we can achieve this layout.
Adding all the items into 1 container div that uses flex to wrap the items
The first item of each ""inner container"" (I'll call it a section) will have a class, which helps us to do some manipulations that create the separation and styling of each section.
Using :before on each first item, we can locate the title of each section.
Using space creates the gap between the sections
Since the space won't cover the full height of the section I'm also adding :after to the sections so positioning it with absolute position and white background.
To style the background color of each section I'm adding another div inside the first item of each section. I will be position with absolute as well and will have z-index: -1.
To get the correct width of each background, I'm using JS, setting the correct width, and also adding a listener to resize.

Explanation: In python, a set contains no duplicates. Thus, you can convert a list to an set (and optionally back to a list again) to remove duplicates. In your case, the simple conversion a = list(set(a)) is not sufficient, since a contains dictionaries, which aren't hashable (requirement for sets). Therefore, we first map the dictionaries to tuples of key-value tuples.
This solution is short, but not great performance-wise, as we have to iterate through a multiple times.",2022-11-27 21:52:59Z,3

 updateVal() {

I think you're confusing two concepts here.
Yes, you're supposed to give Angular a new reference to the array/object to trigger the change detection (thus triggering a rerender)
BUT, you're not supposed to assign the attribute to some string value (in your case 'Row9'.
If you're trying to change the value of exactly one element, you can change it inline with this.arr[0].item = 'Row9'. However, as you might observe, no new render will follow your action. The content of the object in the array will change. If you wan't to trigger a new render / the change detection, you need to create a new reference to the array, e.g., this.arr = [...this.arr] (basically moving all list elements into a new list).",2022-11-26 18:54:01Z,2

For an explanation, see: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/content-configuration#dynamic-class-names
If the possible percentage1 and percentage2 values range from 0 to 100, it's probably best to divide the value by 100 and use a style attribute instead of Tailwind for the transform CSS. For example:

241,74586233,74584702,JHH,20127235,"The data model is like:
To build a spaceship with least build cost, we can:
Step 1. Calculate a part's build_cost = (100 - stage) * cost / 100; for each part, rank the build cost based on stage so we minimize total cost for a spaceship.
Step 2. Based on build_cost, we calcualte the total_cost of a parts by required quantities (in order to compare with spaceship_required_part.amount) and take notes from where the parts are coming from in part_sources, which is in CSV format (city_id, stage, build_cost),...
Step 3. Once we have available parts and total qty & cost calculate, we join it with spaceship_required_part to get result like this:
spaceship_id|spaceship_part_id|amount|total_cost|part_sources         |
------------+-----------------+------+----------+---------------------+
           1|                1|     2|      50.0|(4,80,20),(3,70,30)  |

The above tells us that to build:
spaceship#1, we need part#1 x 2 sourced from city#4 and city#3; part#2 x 1 from city 1; total cost = 50 + 120 = 170, or
spceeship#2, we need part#2 x 2 sourced from city#1 and city#2; part#3 x 1 from city#2; total cost = 160 + 180 = 340, or
spaceship#3, we need part#3 x 2 from city#2 and city#4; total cost = 360.

Here, I prefer to give a more compact and generic answer, that can be re-used in similar cases. The solution below uses random data and omits problem-specific labeling.
It works as follows:
Create some random data with one series for x and two series ya and yb for y.
Set the y axis limits for ya, the minimum for yb and the matching values for both axes, but omit the maximum value for the second axis.
Calculate the maximum for yb.
The rest can then be done as usual.
## create a few random test data
set.seed(123)
x <- 1:10
ya <- runif(x, min = 20, max = 70)
yb <- runif(x, min = -1.5, max= 1)

## set limits for the two y axes, but omit yb_max
ya_min <- 0; ya_max <- 100; yb_min <- -3

## set value, where the two axes should match
ya_match <- 40; yb_match <- -1

## calculate yb_max using linear interpolation (here: extrapolation)
yb_max <- yb_min + (ya_max - ya_min) * (yb_match - yb_min) / (ya_match - ya_min)

## set graphical parameter to increase margin for right axis
par(mar=c(5, 4, 5, 5) + .1)

## plot data set ""a"" 
plot(x, ya, type = ""l"", col = ""black"", ylim = c(ya_min, ya_max))

256,23695709,23695448,Rob Napier,97337,"As Nate Finch notes:
Go run is ... really only meant to be used on very small programs, which generally only need a single file.
Even on unix, go run *.go is often not correct. In any project with unit tests (and every project should have unit tests), this will give the error:
go run: cannot run *_test.go files (something_test.go)
It will also ignore build restrictions, so _windows.go files will be compiled (or attempted to be compiled) on Unix, which is not what you want.
There has been a bit of discussion of making go run work like the rest of the go commands, and there's an open CL for it (5164). It's currently under consideration for Go 1.4. In the meantime, the recommended solution on all platforms is:
go build && ./<executable>",2014-05-16 13:03:51Z,75
257,23695449,23695448,Kevin Burke,329700,"Unix related systems
go run *.go will be sufficient in most cases.
Continue to the below method if this causes errors.
Windows systems (and in other cases where go run *.go doesn't work)
Token expansion doesn't work in the windows command line and hence the above will not work and display an error. go run *.go may also not work in OSs in some cases due to current compiler limitations.
In these cases, use
go build && foo.exe
where foo.exe is the name of the .exe file produced. If perhaps you have no idea what the name of your executable is, first
go build and check the name of the .exe file produced. Afterwards, use the method that includes the file name.
These 2 methods will build and run all the .go files within your current directory with minimum fuss.",2016-05-07 03:28:40Z,26

259,41479692,23695448,r.sendecky,1004369,"The best way to do it is to run it like this:
go run !(*_test).go
It skips all your test files which is exactly what you need to avoid the error.
The other suggestion:
go build && ./<executable>
is a bit annoying. You have to delete the executable all the time to avoid being marked by git. You can put it in gitignore, of course, but I am lazy and this is an extra step.",2018-06-08 05:27:22Z,19

The idea is to delegate the source collection from the parent to the child controls and finally to the ListBox. The ItemsSource properties should be a dependency property of type IList and not IEnumerable. This way you force the binding source to be of type IList which improves the binding performance.
To allow customization of the actual displayed items, you must either
a) spend every control a ItemTemplate property of type DataTemplate and delegate it to the inner most ListBox.ItemTemplate (similar to the ItemsSource property) or
b) define the template as a resource (implicit template, which is a key less DataTemplate).
The example implements a):

Ashamed to admit it but I realized the take profit / stop loss orders are additional separate orders you can send AFTER your first limit/market... order. This means you have to send 2 separate orders to Bianance. If we take a look at my example:
First I send a limit order to open a long/short position. Right after that I can send an equivalent but opposite take profit order (with reduceOnly parameter set to True; improtant!) which will close my position once the criteria are met.
So only after the first order is executed and a position is opened can the second order become ""active"" and close my position.

In any case
Please note that the <scope> is explicitly set to provided for them, which means that Maven should not include the physical JAR files in /WEB-INF/lib of the generated WAR file (because it's already provided by Tomcat itself!). Otherwise you only end up in runtime conflicts caused by duplicate classes in the runtime classpath.
Please also note that Tomcat is not a JEE server and thus importing either javax:javaee-api for Tomcat 9.x or jakarta.platform:jakarta.jakartaee-api for Tomcat 10.x is per definition wrong. Because it will allow you to compile your code against other JEE components such as JSF, JSTL, CDI, BV, EJB, JPA, JAX-RS, JSONB, etc etc while Tomcat actually doesn't offer them out the box. Tomcat only offers Servlet, JSP, EL, WS and JASIC out the box, so you should only declare them in pom.xml.
For example, JSTL needs to be installed separately as instructed in How to install JSTL? The absolute uri: http://java.sun.com/jstl/core cannot be resolved and JSF needs to be installed separately as instructed in How to properly install and configure JSF libraries via Maven? and CDI needs to be installed separately as instructed in How to install and use CDI on Tomcat?
If you're however very well aware of this limitation during developing code for Tomcat (i.e. make sure yourself that you don't accidentally use e.g. JSTL, CDI, BV, JPA, etc without actually installing them in Tomcat first), and merely want to minimize pom.xml boilerplate, then you can also get away with this minimalist dependencies configuration for Tomcat 9.x:
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>javax</groupId>
        <artifactId>javaee-web-api</artifactId>
        <version>8.0</version>
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
Or this for Tomcat 10.0.x:
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
        <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-web-api</artifactId>
        <version>9.0.0</version> <!-- Use 9.1.0 if you're already on Java 11 -->
        <scope>provided</scope>
    </dependency>
</dependencies>
Or this for Tomcat 10.1.x:
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>jakarta.platform</groupId>
        <artifactId>jakarta.jakartaee-web-api</artifactId>
        <version>10.0.0</version>

You don't textValue to access input's result, just use chapterOpinionController.text .
If you want to notify when ever the text change you need to pass a call back like this:

  String label;
  Function(String) onChange;
  int maxLines;
  TextInputType keybordType;
  CustomTextField(
      {Key? key,

      required this.textValue,
      required this.label,
      this.maxLines = 1,
      this.keybordType = TextInputType.text})
      : super(key: key);

  @override
  State<CustomTextField> createState() => _CustomTextFieldState();
}

class _CustomTextFieldState extends State<CustomTextField> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return TextField(
      maxLines: widget.maxLines,

}
then use it like this:

As written, pollForInputEvents fetches one event, checks if it could be considered a quit condition, and then discards all other events in the queue regardless. If event you're looking for happens to be non-first (e.g. as first event you may have keydown of 'ctrl' or mouse move, or window close event, ...), then it never gets processed. handleEvent has the same problem - it gets only first event in frame.
Generally speaking, event processing have to happen in a fast non-blocking loop, which handles events faster than new events are getting in. Processing only one event per frame is a not fast enough, and there is absolutely no reason to process only one event. Events gets accumulated in a queue, you process all events, draw your image frame (potentially slow), present on screen (potentially blocking on vsync), then repeat.

327,56331619,56302020,dpr,4323935,"Using @Scheduled will only allow to use static schedules. You can use properties to make the schedule configruable like this
@Scheduled(cron = ""${yourConfiguration.cronExpression}"")

// or

@Scheduled(fixedDelayString = ""${yourConfiguration.fixedDelay}"")
However the resulting schedule will be fixed once your spring context is initialized (the application is started).
To get fine grained control over a scheduled execution you need implement a custom Trigger - similar to what you already did. Together with the to be executed task, this trigger can be registered by implementing SchedulingConfigurer in your @Configuration class using ScheduledTaskRegistrar.addTriggerTask:
@Configuration
@EnableScheduling
public class AppConfig implements SchedulingConfigurer {
    @Override
    public void configureTasks(ScheduledTaskRegistrar taskRegistrar) {
        taskRegistrar.setScheduler(taskScheduler());
        taskRegistrar.addTriggerTask(() -> myTask().work(), myTrigger());
    }

    @Bean(destroyMethod=""shutdown"")
    public Executor taskScheduler() {
        return Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(42);
    }

    @Bean
    public CustomDynamicSchedule myTrigger() {
        new CustomDynamicSchedule();
    }

    @Bean
    public MyTask myTask() {
        return new MyTask();
    }
}
But don't do any registration of a task in the CustomDynamicSchedule just use it to compute the next execution time:
public class CustomDynamicSchedule extends DynamicSchedule implements Trigger {

    private long delayInterval;

    @Override
    public synchronized void increaseDelayInterval(Long delay) {
        this.delayInterval += delay;
    }

    @Override
    public synchronized void decreaseDelayInterval(Long delay) {
        this.delayInterval += delay;
    }

    @Override
    public synchronized void delay(Long delay) {
        this.delayInterval = delay;
    }

    @Override
    public Date nextExecutionTime(TriggerContext triggerContext) {
        Date lastTime = triggerContext.lastActualExecutionTime();
        return (lastTime == null) ? new Date() : new Date(lastTime.getTime() + delayInterval);
    }
}
But remember to make CustomDynamicSchedule thread safe as it will be created as singleton by spring and might be accessed by multiple threads in parallel.",2020-02-19 17:57:23Z,12
328,56324317,56302020,Mukul Bansal,7209547,"Spring's @Scheduled annotation does not provide this support.
This is my preferred implementation of a similar feature using a Queue-based solution which allows flexibility of timing and very robust implementation of this scheduler functionality.
This is the pipeline-
Cron Maintainer and Publisher- For every task, there is an affiliated cron and a single-threaded executor service which is responsible for publishing messages to the Queue as per the cron. The task-cron mappings are persisted in the database and are initialized during the startup. Also, we have an API exposed to update cron for a task at runtime.
We simply shut down the old scheduled executor service and create a one whenever we trigger a change in the cron via our API. Also, we update the same in the database.
Queue- Used for storing messages published by the publisher.
Scheduler- This is where the business logic of the schedulers reside. A listener on the Queue(Kafka, in our case) listens for the incoming messages and invokes the corresponding scheduler task in a new thread whenever it receives a message for the same.
There are various advantages to this approach. This decouples the scheduler from the schedule management task. Now, the scheduler can focus on business logic alone. Also, we can write as many schedulers as we want, all listening to the same queue and acting accordingly.",2019-05-27 10:42:47Z,1
329,56339318,56302020,evandongen,956884,"With annotation you can do it only by aproximation by finding a common denominator and poll it. I will show you later. If you want a real dynamic solution you can not use annotations but you can use programmatic configuration. The positive of this solution is that you can change the execution period even in runtime! Here is an example on how to do that:
  public initializeDynamicScheduledTAsk (ThreadPoolTaskScheduler scheduler,Date start,long executionPeriod) {
    scheduler.schedule(
      new ScheduledTask(),
      new Date(startTime),period
    );
    }
class ScheduledTask implements Runnable{


    @Override
    public void run() {
       // my scheduled logic here 
    }
}
There is a way to cheat and actually do something with annotations. But you can do that only if precision is not important. What does it mean precision. If you know that you want to start it every 5 seconds but 100ms more or less is not important. If you know that you need to start every 5-6-8 or 10 seconds you can configure one job that is executing every second and check within one if statement how long has it passed since the previous execution. It is very lame, but it works :) as long as you don't need up to millisecond precision. Here is an example:
public class SemiDynamicScheduledService {

private Long lastExecution;
@Value(#{yourDynamicConfiguration})
private int executeEveryInMS

@Scheduled(fixedDelay=1000)
public semiDynamicScheduledMethod() {
   if (System.currentTimeMS() - lastExecution>executeEveryInMS) {
      lastExecution = System.currentTimeMS();
      // put your processing logic here
   }
}

Do a ""self-join"" of the table with itself. For this you must have consecutive ids. Since you don't have such, I am not sure what to do.
Then check whether the (end_date + INTERVAL 1 DAY) of one row matches the start_date of the 'next' row.
Plan C: (requires MySQL 8.0 or MariaDB 10.2)
Use LAG() (or `LEAD() windowing functions to compare a value in one row to the previous (or next) row.

To see why this is not only a theoretical problem, consider this:
type Thunk = Box<dyn FnMut(&mut Config) + Send + 'static>;

struct Config {
    s: String,
    f: Thunk,
}

impl Config {

In this code, we have the callback which essentially drops itself while it is running. Since it captures s by-move, s is dropped along with callback. Then the callback tries to print s - and if that was allowed, we've had a use-after-free.
The solution will depend on the real requirements. The easiest way to go is to separate the configuration, passing to the Thunk only the part which doesn't contain the Thunk itself.",2022-11-27 05:45:07Z,2

Vite 3 does something that Vite 2 doesn't. It automatically sets the ""type"" property in the ""package.json"" file to ""module"". So, one way to fix the problem mentioned by the OP is to either remove it or set it to ""commonjs"". But why does this problem happen in the first place?

It's November 2016 and the answer is finally Yes. But its only SHA-1 and SHA-256 (and by extension, SHA-224).
Intel CPUs with SHA extensions hit the market recently. It looks like processors which support it are Goldmont microarchitecture:
Pentium J4205 (desktop)
Pentium N4200 (mobile)
Celeron J3455 (desktop)
Celeron J3355 (desktop)
Celeron N3450 (mobile)
Celeron N3350 (mobile)
I looked through offerings at Amazon for machines with the architecture or the processor numbers, but I did not find any available (yet). I believe HP Acer had one laptop with Pentium N4200 expected to be available in November 2016 December 2016 that would meet testing needs.
For some of the technical details why it's only SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256, then see crypto: arm64/sha256 - add support for SHA256 using NEON instructions on the kernel crypto mailing list. The short answer is, above SHA-256, things are not easily parallelizable.
You can find source code for both Intel SHA intrinsics and ARMv8 SHA intrinsics at Noloader GitHub | SHA-Intrinsics. They are C source files, and provide the compress function for SHA-1, SHA-224 and SHA-256. The intrinsic-based implementations increase throughput approximately 3× to 4× for SHA-1, and approximately 6× to 12× for SHA-224 and SHA-256.",2017-02-01 23:59:57Z,12

You can read more about them, how to detect if your CPU support them and how to use them here.
(But not SHA-512, you'll still need to manually vectorize that with regular SIMD instructions. AVX512 should help for SHA-512 (and for SHA-1 / SHA-256 on CPUs with AVX512 but not SHA extensions), providing SIMD rotates as well as shifts, for example https://github.com/minio/sha256-simd)
It was hoped that Intel's Skylake microarchitecture would have them, but it doesn't. Intel CPU's with it are low-power Goldmont in 2016, then Goldmont Plus in 2017. Intel's first mainstream CPU with SHA extensions will be Cannon Lake. Skylake / Kaby Lake / Coffee Lake do not.

A C/C++ programmer is probably best off using OpenSSL, which will use whatever CPU features it can to hash quickly. (Including SHA extensions on CPUs that have them, if your version of OpenSSL is new enough.)",2019-01-20 15:22:07Z,21

OpenSSL does use H/W acceleration when present.
On Intel's side Goldmont µarch has (Atom-series) and from Cannonlake (desktop/mobile, 10nm) onwards have SHA-NI support, Cascade Lake server CPUs and older do not support it. Yes, support is non-linear on timeline due to parallel CPU/µarch lines present.
In 2017 AMD released their Zen µarch, so all current server and desktop CPUs based on Zen fully support it.
My benchmark of OpenSSL speed SHA256 showed a 550% speed increase with a block size of 8KiB.
For real 1GB and 5GB files loaded to RAM the hashing was roughly 3x times faster.

Drivers are designed to be deleted by WMI or the driver manager. It is a Windows Logo requirement.
Deleting the driver does not delete the files it just deletes the keys and connections between the OS and the driver. Remember that drivers are installed from ""inf"" files stored in the system folder. All drivers must reside there before then can be installed. Drivers are owned by Windows. They are not owned by the vendor. The vendor merely supplies a file that follows the OS rules for accessing the device. The vendor may supply other files to support specific software. In the case of adapter drivers, it is just glue between Windows and the adapter. Many adapters come with sophisticated utilities to monitor and manage the adapter. These are unnecessary outside of their utility. If the driver is removed they won't work but they will not cause an issue either.
First, disable the driver then delete it. As long as it is loaded you cannot delete it.

load the bytecode into memory
initialize interpreter state
repeat {
   fetch the next instruction,    advance the instruction pointer
   decode the instruction 
   execute the instruction
}
Depending on the bytecode format or structure, the instruction can have either fixed or dynamic length. Data like arrays or strings are typically referenced as (fixed length) memory offsets. The data is embedded in the bytecode separate from the instructions. The data address/offset is an index within the bytecode, as data is stored as sequence of bytes. An instruction to load a string would contain the string offset but not the string data itself.
To fetch and decode the next instruction, it is common to analyze the first one or two bytes which is/are usually the opcode. From this opcode, the length of the instruction is derived. The bytes belonging to the instruction can then be copied into a struct(ure) to disect it further and extract the instruction operand(s).
I can't see where a union would help in this process.

You need to initialize w. For simulation purposes, this can be done with:

module three_bit_counter (output cout, input en, clk, reset);
    reg [2:0] w;

Therefore I'm going to jump immediately to the pain point:
Writable property maps have to return something that models lvalue semantics. Your readJointAngles assumes a ""procedural"" conversion task instead. That's not a property map.
My first thought is to stay close to the concept of the property map by combining the read and write into a proxy class. The proxy class can be VertexProperties itself, but as I can imagine VertexProperties having multiple members with similar requirements, let me do the ""pure"" thing and have it separate here:
struct JointAngleWrapper {
    std::vector<double>& _ref;

    friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, JointAngleWrapper wrapper) {
        for (auto sep = """"; auto el : wrapper._ref)
            os << std::exchange(sep, "","") << el;
        return os;
    }
    friend std::istream& operator>>(std::istream& is, JointAngleWrapper wrapper) {
        std::vector<double> tmp;

        while (is >> tmp.emplace_back())
            if (char comma{}; !(is >> comma) || comma != ',')
                break;

        wrapper._ref = std::move(tmp);

        is.clear();
        return is;
    }
};
Now you can replace the function property-map:
    auto jointAngles = boost::make_function_property_map<Vertex>(
        [ja = get(&VertexProperties::joint_angles, graph)](Vertex v) {
            return JointAngleWrapper{ja[v]};
        });
    dp.property(""Joint_Angles"", jointAngles);
And the output will still be identical. Actually, we have a more light-weight property map abstraction that fits the bill even more elegantly:
    auto jointAngles = make_transform_value_property_map(
        [](std::vector<double>& ja) { return JointAngleWrapper{ja}; },
        get(&VertexProperties::joint_angles, graph));
A Road Bump
However, function_property_map is still not an lvalue-property map. That's sad.
Turns out I forgot about this snag. I've written about this rather central issue with read_graphml (or with dynamic_properties, really) before:
Boost::Graph: how to import graphviz with custom Vertex class (which links to other relevant answers)
The approach I took there was to create my own ReadWritePropertyMap. Which is sensible, given that it essentially merges into what we already have above (JointAngleWrapper).
template <typename Prop> struct JA {
    Prop inner;
    JA(Prop map) : inner(map) { }

    // traits
    using value_type = std::string;
    using reference  = std::string;
    using key_type   = typename boost::property_traits<Prop>::key_type;
    using category   = boost::read_write_property_map_tag;

    friend std::string get(JA map, key_type const& key) {
        std::ostringstream oss;
        for (auto sep = """"; auto el : get(map.inner, key))
            oss << std::exchange(sep, "","") << el;
        return oss.str();
    }
    friend void put(JA map, key_type const& key, value_type const& value) {
        auto& v = get(map.inner, key);
        v.clear();

        std::istringstream iss(value);
        while (iss >> v.emplace_back())
            if (char comma{}; !(iss >> comma) || comma != ',')
                break;
    }
};
Now you can use it with success:
struct BoostGraph {
    Graph graph;

    auto properties() {
        boost::dynamic_properties dp;
        dp.property(""Joint_Angles"", JA{get(&VertexProperties::joint_angles, graph)});
        dp.property(""edge_weight"", get(&EdgeProperties::weight, graph));
        return dp;
    }

    void printGraphML(std::ostream& out) {
        write_graphml(out, graph, properties());
    }

    void readGraphGraphML(std::istream& file) {
        auto dp = properties();
        read_graphml(file, graph, dp);
    }
};
Which successfully roundtrips a ""random"" graph:
#include <boost/graph/random.hpp>
#include <random>

int main() {
    std::stringstream file; // fake file in memory
    {
        BoostGraph g;
        std::mt19937 prng{42};
        generate_random_graph(g.graph, 5, 2, prng);

        for (auto v : boost::make_iterator_range(vertices(g.graph)))
            for (auto& angle : g.graph[v].joint_angles)
                angle = std::uniform_real_distribution<double>(-M_PI, +M_PI)(prng);

        g.printGraphML(file);
    }

    {
        BoostGraph roundtrip;
        roundtrip.readGraphGraphML(file);
        roundtrip.printGraphML(std::cout);
    }

431,74585005,74584412,Chris,15261315,"MAIN DECLARATION:
Your code could benefit from an overall critique, so let's start with the main declaration. The standard clearly states that:
It [main] shall be defined with a return type of int and with no parameters.
There is a difference between
int main()
and
int main(void)
The first one takes an arbitrary amount of arguments, the second one doesn't.
MAGIC NUMBERS:
You have used the magic number 6, 5 times in the code. Consider using a define preprocessor instead:
#define MAX 6
It's easier to change and maintain. You wouldn't like changing 6 at a dozen places instead of just one.
NULL BYTE:
Replace the null byte '\0' with 0.
SIZE:
A common idiom in C to determine the size of an array is to use:
size_t size = sizeof (a) / sizeof (a[0]);
where sizeof(a) is the total number of bytes, and sizeof(a[0]) is the size of one element.
Though, you won't need to compute the size when you already have defined the size as a define statement?
RANDOM-NUMBER-GENERATOR:
The seed should only be set once. The answers to this question srand() — why call it only once? explain it in detail.
ACCESSING ILLEGAL MEMORY
for (i = 0; i <= 6; i++)
You're accessing memory outside of the bounds of the array, which is illegal. The memory not allocated should not be read.
Array-indexing starts at 0 instead of 1. So the sixth element of the array is at index position 5.
ORIGINAL PROBLEM:
You can use a for loop in the main function to print all the values of the array when you're done with all errors.
Consider changing the return type of the function to void as you do not need to return the array back to main when modifying it. The array decays to a pointer in the function parameter, so it's more of an alias. They both are pointing to the same memory, if you modify the memory through one or the other, the memory would be modified for both.

When a new message is posted, you insert it into the database, including a DateTime column. Your message list page then just grabs the latest nn messages, ordered by newest first.
I'm assuming that you know how to do that. If not, do some reading about Entity Framework Core, as that provides a very good way of handling databases.
So, in princple, your question is no more complex than that.

A formulation making this even more likely is x - (x == 0) or x - !!x, which a compiler would typically be able to implement without branches by using CPU specific features. You can even try to replace this by a formulation purely based on bit manipulation. E.g. ((x - 1) & ~x) >> 31 (x unsigned) is 1 only if x == 0, and 0 otherwise. So
x - (((x - 1) & ~x) >> 31)

465,71478057,71477787,Chris,17865804,"Below are given various options on how to convert an uploaded file to FastAPI into a Pandas DataFrame. If you would also like to convert the DataFrame into JSON and return it to the client, have a look at this answer. If you would like to use an async def endpoint instead of def, please have a look at this answer on how to read the file contents in an async way, as well as this answer to understand the difference between using def and async def. It would also be best to enclose the I/O operations (described in the options below) in try-except-finally blocks, so that you can catch/raise any possible exceptions and close the file object properly (as shown here and here).
Option 1
Since pandas.read_csv() can accept a file-like object, you can pass the file-like object of UploadFile directly. UploadFile exposes an actual Python SpooledTemporaryFile that you can get using the .file attribute. Example is given below. Note: The pd.read_csv() isn't an async method, and hence, if you are about to use async def endpoint, it would be better to read the contents of the file using an async method, as described here, and then pass the contents to pd.read_csv() using one of the reamining options below. Alternatively, you can use Starlette's run_in_threadpool() (as described here), which will run the pd.read_csv(file.file) in a separate thread to ensure that the main thread (where coroutines are run) does not get blocked.
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
import pandas as pd

app = FastAPI()

@app.post(""/upload"")
def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    df = pd.read_csv(file.file)
    file.file.close()
    return {""filename"": file.filename}
Option 2
Convert the bytes into a string and then load it into an in-memory text buffer (i.e., StringIO), which can be converted into a dataframe:
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
import pandas as pd
from io import StringIO

app = FastAPI()

@app.post(""/upload"")
def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    contents = file.file.read()
    s = str(contents,'utf-8')
    data = StringIO(s) 
    df = pd.read_csv(data)
    data.close()
    file.file.close()
    return {""filename"": file.filename}
Option 3
Use an in-memory bytes buffer instead (i.e., BytesIO), thus saving you the step of converting the bytes into a string as shown in Option 2:
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
import pandas as pd
from io import BytesIO
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

@app.post(""/upload"")
def upload_file(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    contents = file.file.read()
    data = BytesIO(contents)
    df = pd.read_csv(data)
    data.close()
    file.file.close()
    return {""filename"": file.filename}",2022-11-14 17:29:36Z,3

There are a couple of standard reasons to not directly create Pods, but instead to rely on higher-level constructs. A Deployment can do zero-downtime upgrades; a StatefulSet manages associated PersistentVolumeClaims; a Job can retry on failure. A Pod also can't be edited once created, so you'd need to delete and recreate the Pod on any update. If you're using a Deployment you'll have Pod names like deployment-name-12345678-abcde, but you don't control the ending parts at all. A Service will give you a consistent name.
During an upgrade there won't necessarily be exactly the requested number of replicas:. A Deployment by default will create an additional Pod, wait for it to pass its readiness checks, then tear down the old Pod; an associated Service will route traffic correctly in this case. The alternative is to tear down the old Pod first. In both cases, you could have zero or two matching Pods and not just one.
Having the Service as the standard pattern also helps if you do ever decide to increase the replica count; for example you might choose to run multiple replicas just for additional resiliency in case ons of the Nodes fails.

One way around this is to launch MATLAB from a terminal window. Another way is to manually load the zsh configuration before running your shell command.
A cleaner solution is to avoid ~/.zprofile (loaded for login shells) and ~/.zshrc (loaded for interactive shells), and instead put your configuration in ~/.zshenv (loaded for all shells, including the one started by MATLAB for system() or !).

So second option is do it yourself style: /api/article/controller/article.js

   findOne(ctx){
      const { slug } = ctx.params;
      return strapi.db.query('api::article.article').findOne({where: {slug});
   }
});
then in the routes create routes.js file /api/article/routes/routes.js
module.exports = {
  routes: [
     {
       method: 'GET',
       path: '/articles/:slug'
       handler: 'article.findOne'
     }
  ]
}
then if you want to create articles for outside of admin, create lifecycles.js in /api/article/content-types/article/lifecycles.js
module.exports = {
  async beforeCreate(event) {
     // here you have to do something like
     let slug = slugify(event.result.name);
     let isNotFree = await strapi.db.query(""api::article.article"").findOne({where: {slug}});

     if (Boolean(!isNotFree)) // < not sure prolly need an empty object check 
       for (let i = 1; i < 9999 ; i++) {
       slug = `${slug}-${i}`;

Run code snippetExpand snippet

Each row is given a left property using nth-child
Each column is given a top property using a nth-child trick to get only first 4n elements (where subsequent grabs overwrite the top)
This means all elements have both left and top set which means transition can be used on hover
This doesn't use the grid layout which means it's harder to expand or interact with this grid
There is no way (which I know) to selectivly turn on and off pointer-events on hover on and off which means you must hover off to select a different item.

This uses JS to capture the mouse and add the focus class to whichever element should be focused which is then expanded using combined css and javascript transforming
This uses the grid layout which makes it easily scalable and customizable unlike CSS only.
Unlike CSS only, all elements shift around as no absolute positioning is being used which may not be preferable
The perfect solution
The perfect solution would be to create elements with JS and keep everything in JS, which, although incredibly time consuming would work perfectly",2022-11-26 18:30:42Z,3

no VLAs (I heard they are the devil and to always avoid them and not to talk to people who suggest using them in any scenario.
VLAs are a problem if you want your code to work with Microsoft's stunted C compiler, as MS has steadfastly refused to implement VLA support, even when C99, in which VLA support was mandatory, was the current language standard. Generally speaking, I would suggest avoiding Microsoft's C compiler altogether if you can, but I will stop well short of suggesting the avoidance of people who advise you differently.
VLAs are also a potential problem when you declare an automatic object of VLA type, without managing the maximum dimension. Especially so when the dimension comes from user input. This produces a risk of program crash that is hard to test or mitigate at development time, except by avoiding the situation in the first place.
But it is at best overly dramatic to call VLAs ""the devil"", and I propose that anyone who actually told you ""not to talk to people who suggest using them in any scenario"" must not have trusted you to understand the issues involved or to evaluate them for yourself. In particular, pointers to VLAs are a fine way to address all your points besides ""no VLAs"", and they have no particular technical issues other than lack of support by (mostly) Microsoft. Support for these will be mandatory again in C2X, the next C language specification, though support for some other forms of VLA use will remain optional.
Your requirements
If any of the dimensions of an array type are not given by integer constant expressions, then that type is by definition a variable-length array type. If any dimension but the first of an array type is not given by an integer constant expressions then you cannot express the corresponding pointer type without using a VLA.
Therefore, if you want a contiguously allocated multidimensional array (array of arrays) for which any dimension other than the first is chosen at runtime, then a VLA type must be involved. Allocating such an object dynamically works great and has little or no downside other than lack of support by certain compilers (which is a non-negligible consideration, to be sure). It would look something like this:
void do_something(size_t rows, size_t columns) {
    int (*my_array)[columns];  // pointer to VLA

    my_array = malloc(rows * sizeof(*my_array));

    // ... access elements as my_array[row][col] ...
}
You should have seen similar in some of the Q&As you reference in the question.
If that's not acceptable, then you need to choose which of your other requirements to give up. I would suggest the ""multi-dimensional"" part. Instead, allocate (effectively) a one-dimensional array, and use it as if it had two dimensions by performing appropriate index computations upon access. This should perform almost as well, because it's pretty close to what the compiler will set up automatically for a multidimensional array. You can make it a bit easier on yourself by creating a macro to assist with the computations. For example,
#define ELEMENT_2D(a, dim2, row, col) ((a)[(row) * (dim2) + (col)])

void do_something(size_t rows, size_t columns) {
    int *my_array;

    my_array = malloc(rows * columns * sizeof(*my_array));

    // ... access elements as ELEMENT_2D(my_array, columns, row, col) ..
}
Alternatively, you could give up the contiguous allocation and go with an array of pointers instead. This is what people who don't understand arrays, pointers, and / or dynamic allocation typically do, and although there are some applications, especially for arrays of pointers to strings, this form has mostly downside relative to contiguous allocation for the kinds of applications where one wants an object they think of as a 2D array.",2022-11-27 13:53:55Z,4
553,74584274,74584190,Jonathan Leffler,15168,"Suppose you need a 2D array of size W x H containing ints (where H is the number of rows, and W the number of columns).
Then you can do the the following:
Allocation:
int * a = malloc(W * H * sizeof(int));
Access element at location (i,j):
int val = a[j * W + i];
a[j * W + i] = val;
The whole array would occupy a continuous block of memory, and can be dynamically allocated (without VLAs). Being a continuous block of memory offers an advantage over an array of pointers due to [potentially] fewer cache misses.
In such an array, the term ""stride"" refers to the offset between one row to another. If you need to use padding e.g. to make sure all lines start at some aligned address, you can use a stride which is bigger than W.",2022-11-26 19:15:57Z,1

the classic pointer to array of pointers to individually malloc'd memory
one pointer to contignuous memory, accessed with a[x * COLS + y]

TL;DR:
the second one appears to be faster by 2-12% compared to the others, which are sort of similar in performance.

558,74584379,74584180,rodrigo,865874,"If you look at the documentation of trim() you'll notice that it's not a member of String but of str:
pub fn trim(&self) -> &str
That is, it takes a &str (string slice) and returns another &str, a subslice, with the same lifetime.
Now, your code is equivalent of doing something like:
let s: &str = String::from("" hello "").trim();
That would create a temporary String, borrow it as a &str, and compute its trim slice. Then the temporary is dropped and the trimmed slice reference is invalidated. Fortunately Rust lifetime rules prevents you from trying to use that invalid value.
If you save a temporary value in a variable you avoid dropping it, as you noticed in your code.
let s: String = String::from("" hello "");
let s: &str = s.trim();
And now the code does what you want.
If you do not need to ever use the temporary it is idiomatic in Rust to use the same name for both values, to illustrate that point, and to avoid having to think of two names (naming things is hard). Note that the first s still exists, it is not destroyed by having another variable with the same name, it is just shadowed, and it will be dropped normally at the end of its scope.",2022-11-26 17:42:06Z,2

   pub fn dfs_parent_child(self) ...
   pub fn get_leaves(self) ...
To not consume the I3Info, allowing it to be used more than once, declare your methods to take references to the I3Info:
   pub fn dfs_parent_child(&self) ...
   pub fn get_leaves(&self) ...
You will need to modify the code within these methods, also, to work with references because this change also means you can no longer move things out of self — they have to be left intact. Sometimes this is as simple as putting & before a field access (&self.foo instead of self.foo), and sometimes it will require more extensive changes.
The general “Rust way of thinking” lessons here are:
Think about the type of your method receivers. self is not always right, and neither is &self.
Don't take ownership of values except when it makes sense. Passing by & reference is a good default choice (except for Copy types, like numbers).",2022-11-26 19:01:05Z,2

Well, that's kind of the point, isn't it? Is it really ""safe"" if all it takes for some code to become ""unsafe"" is for someone to inadvertently use the variable at the wrong time? If the difference between ""safe"" and ""completely broken"" is changing the order of two lines, and no compiler can catch the problem, is it really ""safe?""
If you invoke an asynchronous action, the primary reason you did that was because you wanted to do something else while that action is going on. So leaving the current stack frame is kind of the point. Most code does not look like your simplistic example.
Your example is only ""safe"" because it is simplistic. Introduce any complexity, and it becomes increasingly unsafe.
Did the thread raise an exception instead of returning a valid value? Did you make sure that the lifetime of the object being referenced persists until the thread is finished writing to it? If you want the thread to be able to finish with a task and go do a different one (instead of incurring the cost of creating a new std::thread every time you want to do an async process), how do you communicate when the value is ready to the outside world?
promise/future has answers to all of these questions. It has an explicit mechanism for sheparding exceptions across threads. The lifetime of the shepherded object is rigidly controlled, so that simply can't break. Each promise/future is independent and thus a thread could have many of them, and any future can tell when the promised value is ready. Etc.
In summary, promise/future are tools that are safe at scale. Yours is increasingly less safe the more complexity is introduced.",2022-11-26 17:30:06Z,3

Now, why do we need to wrap pagedown::chrome_print inside a function to use the timeout argument and then wrap the whole function inside a parenthesis?
From the section 17.5 of Rmarkdown Cookbook, Customizing the knit button,
It is possible to control the behavior of the Knit button by providing the knit field within the YAML frontmatter of your document. The field takes a function with the main argument input (the path to the input Rmd document) and other arguments that are currently ignored.
If you store the code directly within YAML, you must wrap the entire function in parentheses. If the source code has multiple lines, you have to indent all lines (except the first line) by at least two spaces.",2022-11-26 17:49:52Z,1

It's even more complicated if the Fragment might not even be added to the UI at all! If it's not there, what value are you supposed to use? If you want to somehow create the Fragment just so it exists, and so you can read the value from its text box, then that's a sign the value really needs to be stored somewhere else, so you don't need the Fragment if you want to access it.
The easiest, recommended, and modern way to share data like this is with a ViewModel:
class MyViewModel : ViewModel() {
    // setting a default value here!
    var currentHour: Int = 0
}
class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
    val model: MyViewModel by viewModels()

    fun onCreate(...) {
        ...
        onOffButton.setOnClickListener {
            // access the data in the ViewModel
            val currentHour = model.currentHour
        }
    }
}
class MyFragment : Fragment() {
    // using activityViewModels so we get the parent Activity's copy of the VM,
    // so we're all sharing the same object and seeing the same data
    val model: MyViewModel by activityViewModels()
    
    fun onViewCreated(...) {
        ...
        hoursPicker.setOnValueChangeListener { _, _, newValue ->
            // update the VM
            model.currentHour = newValue
        }
    }
}
So basically, you have this ViewModel object owned by the Activity and visible to its Fragments. The VM outlives all of those components, so you don't lose data while an Activity is being destroyed on rotation, or when a Fragment isn't added to the UI, etc.
The VM is the source of data, everything else just reads from it, or updates it when something changes (like when the Fragment updates the variable when its number picker's value changes). This way, the Activity doesn't need to go ""ask"" the Fragment for info - it's stored in a central location, in the VM
This is the most basic way to use a ViewModel - you can start using LiveData and Flow objects to make different UI components observe data and react to changes too. For example, your button in your Activity could change some enabled state in the VM, and the Fragment (if it's added) will see that change and can do things like make the number picker visible or invisible.
It's way easier to coordinate this stuff with a ViewModel, so if you don't already know how to use them, I'd recommend learning it!",2022-11-26 18:12:40Z,0

is trying to be read in your code, but either it is a declared variable which has not been initialized, or, more probably, it should be a key of an object which is not actually included in it (or maybe the object itself is undefined).
In our example, it means that response.data has not includes property, or even response has no data property at all.
If this variable comes out of an http request, this happens quite often due to distraction (for example, when one writes response.includes instead of response.data.includes). In that case, you'd better print the former variable with console.log to see what's wrong.",2022-11-27 00:17:53Z,0

so, if you have some other aspx pages that you want to use? then from vs choose add->existing item, and then you can browse to that aspx page. This is really a SIMPLE IMPORT of that page into the current project.
So, the web pages and folders MUST exist in your current project, and you are NOT free to reference or use or have aspx pages outside of your current project. The web site layout will not work correclty.
Now, you can ceratinly refernce other projects ""code"" and things like other libraries of code. But a aspx web page is going to be converted to standard HTML for a browser, and those aspx pages will become the url of the web site, and thus all such pages must be in the root of the project, or in sub folders of that root project.
So, you might have:
  Welcome.aspx
but, you can say add a new folder to this project, and maybe call it
 SiteAdmin
So, now, you can place aspx pages in that folder, and your URL will become:
http:mycoolebsite/SiteAdmin/Manage.aspx
so, yes, all aspx pages have to be part of the starting folder for the web site.
it not at all clear what you mean by ""link"".
I mean, one can have page1.aspx, and then page2.aspx.
you can the drop a button in page 1, and when you click on it, it jumps to page2. This would not really be called ""linking"", but navagation to another page.
You can thus of course add a hyper-link in page one. or you can drop in a button, and with some code jump/navigate to that page2.aspx.
So, assuming I have page1.aspx, and page2.aspx, then you are free to drop in a button, say like this:
   <asp:Button ID=""Button1"" runat=""server"" Text=""Jump to page2.aspx""
     OnClick=""Button1_Click"" />
And code behind could be this:
Protected Sub Button1_Click(sender As Object, e As EventArgs)

    Response.Redirect(""~/page2.aspx"")

End Sub
But, you don't have to use code behind, and you can say drop in a hyperlink control, and do this without code.
eg:
   <asp:HyperLink ID=""HyperLink1"" runat=""server""
   NavigateUrl=""~/About.aspx"">HyperLink</asp:HyperLink>
So, you can jump/navagate from a html page to a aspx page by using a hyperlink.
If this is a html page, then use a html control, not a asp.net one, and thus use:
<a href=""About.aspx"">About our site</a>
So, you can use a plain jane hyper link, and use one in a aspx page, or a html page",2022-11-26 17:25:18Z,0

698,74585669,74583911,zsolt,4223799,"I think you are mixing up volumes and bind mounts. https://docs.docker.com/storage/
VOLUME Dockerfile command: A volume with the VOLUME command in a Dockerfile is created into the docker area on the host that is /var/lib/docker/volumes/.
I don't think it is possible to run docker without it having access to this directory or it would be not advisable to restrict permission of docker to these directories, these are dockers own directories after all.
So postgres dockerfile has this command in dockerfile, for example: https://github.com/docker-library/postgres/blob/master/15/bullseye/Dockerfile
line 186: VOLUME /var/lib/postgresql/data
This means that the /var/lib/postgresql/data directory that is inside the postgres container will be a VOLUME that will be stored on the host somewhere in /var/lib/docker/volumes/somerandomhashorguid..... in a directory with a random name.
You can also create a volume like this with docker run:
docker run --name mypostgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -v /etc postgres:15.1
This way the /etc directory that is inside the container will be stored on the host in the /var/lib/docker/volumes/somerandomhashorguid.....
This volume solution is needed for containers that need extra IO, because the files of the containers (that are not in volumes) are stored in the writeable layer as per the docs: ""Writing into a container’s writable layer requires a storage driver to manage the filesystem. The storage driver provides a union filesystem, using the Linux kernel. This extra abstraction reduces performance as compared to using data volumes, which write directly to the host filesystem.""
So you could technically remove the VOLUME command from the postgres dockerfile and rebuild the image for yourself and use that image to create your postgres container but it would have lesser performance.
Bind mounts are the type of data storage solution that can be mounted to anywhere on the host filesystem. For example if you would run:
docker run --name mypostgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -v /tmp/mypostgresdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data postgres:15.1
(Take not of the -v flag here, there is a colon between the host and the container directory while previously in the volume version of this flag there was no host directory and no colon either.)
then you would have a directory created on your docker host machine /tmp/mypostgresdata and the directory of the container of /var/lib/postgresql/data would be mapped here instead of the docker volumes internal directory /var/lib/docker/volumes/somerandomhashorguid.....
My general rule of thumb would be to use volumes - as in /var/lib/docker/volumes/ - whenever you can and deviate only if really necessary. Bind mounts are not flexible enough to make an image/container portable and the writable container layer has less performance than docker volumes.
You can list docker volumes with docker volume ls but you will not see bind mounted directories here. For that you will need to do docker inspect containername",2022-11-26 21:23:12Z,1

Rather I suspect that what you want to do is introduce a new workoutlist table that is populated with predefined/pre-existing rows in the workoutlist as per a database supplied as an asset. In this case you do not want to use the createFromAsset method (although you could potentially have a second database created from the asset, attach it to the original and then merge the data - this would be more complex than it need be).
You also have to consider how to handle new installs, in which case there will be no existing user input workouts and workoutsetss, in which case you could use createFromAsset method. However, you would not want any other user's workouts and workoutsetss rows.
Based upon this assumption perhaps consider this demo that introduces a new table (workoutlist) whose data is retrieved from an asset maintaining the original user data in the other tables (workout and workoutset) but for a new install of the App creates database from the asset.

This has been written to allow easy switching/running of the App with either version, simply two changes to run as old or new version of the App.
to run as version 1 DATABASE_VERSION (in MainActivity) is set to 1
AND the WorkoutSet class is commented out in the @Database annotation.
the Mirgration handles the copy of the data from the asset if the database already exists, otherwise for a new file then createFromAssets is used to copy the database from the asset.
MainActivity the activity code that does something with the database to ensure that it is opened/accessed
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {

    public static final String DATABASE_NAME = ""workout.db"";
    public static final int DATABASE_VERSION = 2;
    public static final String DATABASE_ASSET_NAME = ""testit.db""/*DATABASE_NAME*/ /* could be different */;

    WorkoutDatabase wdb;
    AllDAO dao;

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
        wdb = WorkoutDatabase.getInstance(this);
        dao = wdb.getAllDAO();

        if (dao.getNumberOfWorkouts() < 1) addInitialData();
        //wdb.close(); // FORCE close so WAL is full checkpointed (i.e. no -wal or -shm)
    }

    private void addInitialData() {
        String prefix = String.valueOf(System.currentTimeMillis()); // to differentiate devices
        dao.insert(new Workout(prefix + ""-W001""));
        dao.insert(new Workout(prefix + ""-W002""));
        dao.insert(new WorkoutSet(prefix + ""-WS001"",1));
        dao.insert(new WorkoutSet(prefix + ""-WS002"",2));
    }
}
note the wdb.close() is uncommented when creating the database to be loaded into the SQlite tool.
testit.db the SQLite database file as modified to introduce the new workoutList table. This first copied from a run of the App at Version 1 and then adding the new table (according SQL copied from the createAllTables method of WorkoutDataabase_Impl class in the generated java (aka the exact table as per Room's expectations)).
Note really the rows should be deleted as they are user specific. Instead -WRONG has been added to the end of the data (helps to prove the some points)
as above
The new table
Navicat was the SQLite tool used rather than DB Browser.
Run 1 running at version 1 to populate the database
DATABASE_VERSION = 1
@Database(entities = {Workout.class,WorkoutSet.class/*, WorkoutList.class*/ /*<<<<<<<<<< ADDED for V2 */}, exportSchema = false, version = MainActivity.DATABASE_VERSION)
i.e. the WorkoutList table has been excluded
App Inspection shows:-
and
Impotantly no WorkoutList table
Run 2 version 2 and introduction of new workoutlist table
DATABASE_VERSION = 2
@Database(entities = {Workout.class,WorkoutSet.class, WorkoutList.class /*<<<<<<<<<< ADDED for V2 */}, exportSchema = false, version = MainActivity.DATABASE_VERSION)
i.e. WorkoutList now introduced
App Inspection shows:-
old rows retained (they do not have -WRONG as per the asset)
old rows retained
the new table, populated as per the asset
Run 3 new install (after App uninstalled) at VERSION 2
as an be seen the incorrectly left in the assets rows exist (obviously you would delete the rows in real life but leaving them in shows that they are from the asset rather than generated by the code in the activity)
likewise
Conclusion
So the new install of the App correctly copies the asset database via createFromAsset whilst if migrating only the new data in the workoutlist table is copied from the asset.",2022-11-27 01:07:55Z,1

This means that your frame_bytes array is not an array of samples, it's an array of bytes in which every two bytes together form one sample. (And because nchannels is 1, there is one sample per frame, mono audio.) So when you changed the LSB of all the bytes, you were changing not only the LSB of each sample, but also a bit in the middle of it.
You should convert this to an array of samples, and then change the samples LSBs. You can use array for this:
import array

samples = array.array('h', frame_bytes)  # signed 16-bit
# ... modify the samples ...
frames_modified = samples.tobytes()
Of course, it would be best if your code checked beforehand if you're dealing with signed shorts (sampsize==2) or unsigned bytes (sampsize==1), and then handle them accordingly. You might do something like:
samples = array.array('h' if sampsize == 2 else 'B', frame_bytes)

    samples[i] = samples[i] & -2 | bit

Comments:
in order to find out the number of rows, you could use stats (check help stats). With this gnuplot-only and platform-independent, unlike your n = system(sprintf('cat %s | wc -l', filedata))
row index starts at 0, e.g. every ::0::j. But since you have a headerline this line will not be plotted because it is text data.
there is the plotting style with labels. With this you can plot the value from column 1 somewhere as label, here at x,y,z ... u (7):(10):(10) ....

1 - How can I create multi parameter filter?
""Query By Example""!:
Query by Example is well suited for several use cases:
Querying your data store with a set of static or dynamic constraints.
Frequent refactoring of the domain objects without worrying about breaking existing queries.
Working independently from the underlying data store API.
, it's ""limitations"" sound more like ""features"" in this ""scenario"":
Query by Example also has several limitations:
No support for nested or grouped property constraints, such as firstname = ?0 or (firstname = ?1 and lastname = ?2).#(we must suffice with ""all AND/OR"".)
Only supports starts/contains/ends/regex matching for strings...#(which is super)
... and exact matching for other property types.#;(;(
(see ""Hands On"")
2 - How can I make all of the parameters optional
since user can search other users by one or more params?
In controller, just like Spring MVC: Complex object as GET @RequestParam :
@RequestMapping(""/users"") 
public ResponseDto users(RequestDto pInput // ...
In query, by configuring a ""correct"" Example. (see ""Hands On"")
3 - How should the endpoint for this request look like?
Again, the only solution that comes to my mind is: http://localhost:8080/users/{firstName}/{lastName}/{address}/{birthNumber} ....
No Way! Please don't use ""path variables"" for ""nullable parameters"" (neither for too fancy things, e.g. Strings containing /...). (See ""2 - How can I..."", ""Hands On"")
It can rather (for GET requests) look like:
http://localhost:8080/users?firstname=John&lastname=Doe&sort..&mode...&page...
or just like:
http://localhost:8080/users.

If you add 'middle' to names, it should work out of the box.
Note: haven't tested it, since you haven't provided a sandbox. If it doesn't work, I'll make one and test it.
I tend to avoid @input + :value (although it works), in favor of v-model with computed setter. Has the advantage of not having to cast the input type and also allows assigning to model programmatically, should you ever need it. I also find the resulting syntax cleaner, hence more readable:

Splice is mutating state directly, to prevent this, you can use spread operator to make a copy of array.
2ndly, The Button is inside Anchor Tag and both have onClick, So when the cross button is clicked, Parent anchor onclick is also called, To prevent this, you can do e.stopPropagation().

                return .init(self[start..<end])
            }
        )
    }
}
Usage:
struct UserModel: Codable {
    let userid: Int
    let nickname: String
}

let users = [
    (1,""a""),
    (2,""b""),
    (3,""c""),

userSplit[1][0].nickname  // ""e""
userSplit[1][1].nickname  // ""f""
userSplit[1][2].nickname  // ""g""
userSplit[1][3].nickname  // ""h""
userSplit[2][0].nickname  // ""i""
userSplit[2][1].nickname  // ""j""
edit/update:
If you don't want to duplicate the collection elements you can just iterate the original collection subsequences. Something like:
extension Collection {
    func unfoldSubSequences(limitedTo maxLength: Int) -> UnfoldSequence<SubSequence,Index> {
        sequence(state: startIndex) { start in
            guard start < endIndex else { return nil }
            let end = index(start, offsetBy: maxLength, limitedBy: endIndex) ?? endIndex
            defer { start = end }
            return self[start..<end]
        }
    }
    func subSequences(limitedTo maxLength: Int) -> [SubSequence] { .init(unfoldSubSequences(limitedTo: maxLength))
    }
}
Usage:
let subSequences = users.subSequences(limitedTo: 4)

subSequences[0][0].nickname  // ""a""
subSequences[0][1].nickname  // ""b""
subSequences[0][2].nickname  // ""c""
subSequences[0][3].nickname  // ""d""
subSequences[1][4].nickname  // ""e""
subSequences[1][5].nickname  // ""f""
subSequences[1][6].nickname  // ""g""
subSequences[1][7].nickname  // ""h""
subSequences[2][8].nickname  // ""i""
subSequences[2][9].nickname  // ""j""

for subsequence in subSequences {
    for user in subsequence {
        print(user)
    }
}
This will print
UserModel(userid: 1, nickname: ""a"")
UserModel(userid: 2, nickname: ""b"")
UserModel(userid: 3, nickname: ""c"")
UserModel(userid: 4, nickname: ""d"")
UserModel(userid: 5, nickname: ""e"")
UserModel(userid: 6, nickname: ""f"")
UserModel(userid: 7, nickname: ""g"")
UserModel(userid: 8, nickname: ""h"")
UserModel(userid: 9, nickname: ""i"")
UserModel(userid: 10, nickname: ""j"")
And to make it complete you can extend RangeReplaceableCollection as follow. This would work with Strings as well (Collection of Characters):
extension RangeReplaceableCollection {
    func groups(limitedTo maxLength: Int) -> [Self] {
        subSequences(limitedTo: maxLength).map(Self.init)
    }
}

Alternatively, you can run export MSYS=winsymlinks:sys and that tells MSYS2 to create a special type of symlink that is recognized by MSYS programs like git and ls but is not recognized by Windows itself.

870,74584071,74583631,Milos Pavlovic,19397457,"You need to define user-defined type guards in order to validate your input against certain type(s). Those guards are most useful when element can be isomorphic(to have more than one type) or when element can have on of many union types, which is your case. More about guards can be found here enter link description here
For example, you can define guards like this:
const isButton= (el: element): el is button=> el.type === ""button"";
const isText= (el: element): el is text => el.type === ""text"";
And then use it inside your function like this:
  function elementGetter(el: element) {
    const elementIsButton = isButton(el);
    const elementIsText = isText(el);
    
    if(elementIsButton) {
       // Do smth..
    }
    if(elementIsText) {
      // Do smt else

Great thing about type guards is the fact that they do work together with compiler, meaning, for example, that inside if(elementIsButton) guard will let compiler to know that element is of type button.",2022-11-26 16:59:22Z,0
871,74583684,74583630,Ahmed AEK,15649230,"to explain this, let's define this function:
def import_math():
    import math

import_math()
the above function will import the module math, but only in its local scope, anyone that tries to reference math outside of it will get a name error, because math is not defined in the global scope.
any module that is imported is saved into sys.modules so a call to check
import_math()
print(""math"" in sys.modules)
will print True, because sys.modules caches any module that is loaded anywhere, whether or not it was available in the global scope, a very simple way to define math in the global scope would then to
import_math()
math = sys.modules[""math""]
which will convert it from being only in sys.modules to being in the global scope, this is just equivalent to
import math
which defines a variable math in the global scope that points to the module math.
now if you want to see whether ""math"" exists in the global scope is to check if it is in the global scope directly.
print(""math"" in globals())
print(""math"" in locals())
which will print false if ""math"" wasn't imported into the global or local scope and is therefore inaccessable.",2022-11-26 16:26:49Z,6

It outputs a dataframe, which is the format you would like to end up with
Has a comment input argument, with which you can define lines that are to be ignored
You can use the = sign as a separator, which will make you able to split up your data in the wanted sections

Notice that you still have that lefternmost column with the index number, I did not clean it out because I wasn't sure of what you wanted there.
Also, importantly, you need to be aware that if there is a slight difference in the names of the columns in your files (e.g. impulsion specifique vs impulsion spécifique) this will bring errors. You will need to create error handling procedures for these. Or maybe enforcing a certain schema, but that is out of the scope of this question.

So, what is important is that the class name value that you register must match the class name value that you pass to CreateWindowEx(). They do not need to be pointing at the same memory address.",2022-11-26 20:51:37Z,3

931,74583528,74583505,Martijn Pieters,100297,"You can slice Python lists using a step (sometimes called a stride), you can use this to get every second element, starting at index 1 (for the first letter):
>>> example = ['30', 'M', '1', 'D', '120', 'M']
>>> example[1::2]
['M', 'D', 'M']
The [1::2] syntax means: start at index 1, go on until you run out of elements (nothing entered between the : delimiters), and step over the list to return every second value.
You can do the same thing for the numbers, using [::2], so begin with the value right at the start and take every other value.
If you then combine this with the zip() function you can pair up your numbers and letters to figure out what to sum:
def sum_m_values(values):
    summed = []
    m_sum = 0
    for number, letter in zip(values[::2], values[1::2]):
        if letter != ""M"":
            if m_sum:
                summed += (str(m_sum), ""M"")
                m_sum = 0
            summed += (number, letter)
        else:
            m_sum += int(number)
    if m_sum:
        summed += (str(m_sum), ""M"")
    return summed
The above function takes your list of numbers and letters and:
creates a list for the results
tracks a running sum of ""M"" values
pairs up the numbers and letters
for each pair:
if it is a number and ""M"", add that value (as an integer) to the running sum.
otherwise, adds the running sum (if any) to the list with the letter ""M"", then adds the current number and letter too.
after all pairs are processed, adds the running sum and the letter ""M"", if there is any.
This covers all your example inputs:
>>> def sum_m_values(values):
...     summed = []
...     m_sum = 0
...     for number, letter in zip(values[::2], values[1::2]):
...         if letter != ""M"":
...             if m_sum:
...                 summed += (str(m_sum), ""M"")
...                 m_sum = 0
...             summed += (number, letter)
...         else:
...             m_sum += int(number)
...     if m_sum:
...         summed += (str(m_sum), ""M"")
...     return summed
...
>>> examples = [
...     ['20', 'M', '10', 'M', '1', 'D', '14', 'M', '106', 'M'],
...     ['124', 'M', '19', 'M', '7', 'M'],
...     ['19', 'M', '131', 'M'],
...     ['3', 'M', '19', 'M', '128', 'M'],
...     ['12', 'M', '138', 'M'],
... ]
>>> for example in examples:
...     print(example, ""->"", sum_m_values(example))
...
['20', 'M', '10', 'M', '1', 'D', '14', 'M', '106', 'M'] -> ['30', 'M', '1', 'D', '120', 'M']
['124', 'M', '19', 'M', '7', 'M'] -> ['150', 'M']
['19', 'M', '131', 'M'] -> ['150', 'M']
['3', 'M', '19', 'M', '128', 'M'] -> ['150', 'M']
['12', 'M', '138', 'M'] -> ['150', 'M']
There are other methods of looping over a list in fixed-sized groups; you can also create an iterator for the list with iter()and then use zip() to pull in consecutive elements into pairs:
it = iter(inputlist)
for number, letter in zip(it, it):
    # ...
This works because zip() gets the next element for each value in the pair from the same iterator, so ""30"" first, then ""M"", etc.:
>>> example = ['124', 'M', '19', 'M', '7', 'M']
>>> it = iter(example)
>>> for number, letter in zip(it, it):
...     print(number, letter)
...
124 M
19 M
7 M
However, for short lists it is perfectly fine to use slicing, as it can be understood more easily.
Next, you can make the summing a little easier by using the itertools.groupby() function to give you your number + letter pairs as separate groups. That function takes an input sequence, and a function to produce the group identifier. When you then loop over its output you are given that group identifier and an iterator to access the group members (those elements that have the same group value).
Just pass it the zip() iterator build before, and either lambda pair: pair[1] or operator.itemgetter(1); the latter is a little faster but does the same thing as the lambda, get the letter from the number + letter pair.
With separate groups, the logic starts to look a lot simpler:
from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter

def sum_m_values(values):
    summed = []
    it = iter(values)
    paired = zip(it, it)

    for letter, grouped in groupby(paired, itemgetter(1)):
        if letter == ""M"":
            total = sum(int(number) for number, _ in grouped)
            summed += (str(total), letter)
        else:
            # add the (number, ""D"") as separate elements
            for number, letter in grouped:
                summed += (number, letter)
            
    return summed
The output of the function hasn't changed, only the implementation.
Finally, we could turn the function into a generator function, by replacing the summed += ... statements with yield from ..., so it'll still generate a sequence of numeric strings and letters:
from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter

def sum_m_values(values):
    it = iter(values)
    paired = zip(it, it)

    for letter, grouped in groupby(paired, itemgetter(1)):
        if letter == ""M"":
            total = sum(int(number) for number, _ in grouped)
            yield from (str(total), letter)
        else:
            # add the (number, ""D"") as separate elements
            for number, letter in grouped:
                yield from (number, letter)
You can then use list(sum_m_values(...)) to get a list again, or just use the generator as-is. For long inputs, that could be the preferred option as that means you never need to keep everything in memory all at once.
If you can guarantee that only numbers with M repeat (so a D pair is always followed by an M pair or is the last pair in the sequence), you can even just drop the if test and just always sum:
from itertools import groupby
from operator import itemgetter

def sum_m_values(values):
    it = iter(values)
    paired = zip(it, it)

    for letter, grouped in groupby(paired, itemgetter(1)):
        yield str(sum(int(number) for number, _ in grouped))
        yield letter
This works because there will only ever be one number value per D group, summing won’t make that into a different number.",2022-11-27 18:28:25Z,2

A destructuring assignment where the left side has [ ...rest] notation will create an array for rest. When it has { ...rest} notation, it will create a plain object for rest.
In the first case, the array values from the right hand side are iterated, and these populate the left hand array.
In the second case, the object entries from the right hand side are iterated, and these define the key/value pairs of the left hand object.
Could someone demonstrate the steps that occur above, without using destructuring?
Like this:
let foo = {};
for (const pair of [1, 2].entries()) {
    foo[pair[0]] = pair[1];
}

console.log(foo);

Is there a place in the ECMA spec (or similar) where the behavior is explained?
The ECMA Script reference is at Destructuring Assignment, and the ObjectAssignmentPattern with AssignmentRestProperty. In that section you'll find Runtime Semantics: RestDestructuringAssignmentEvaluation.
There you see a plain object is created (in step 2). In step three the procedure CopyDataProperties ( target, source, excludedItems ) is executed. This copies enumerable (see step 4.c.ii) properties of the source object (in your case an array object) into the target object.
It is important to stress that only own, enumerable properties are included, which explains why for instance the length property is not copied into the target object.",2022-11-26 15:58:59Z,3

When you try to subset a variable with a vector that contains NA's, the result will also have NA's:

That's why there were NA's in your second attempt.
But dplyr::filter ""ignores"" NA's, that is, it filters out rows where the condition returns FALSE or NA. That's why there weren't NA's in your first attempt.
Two hints to improve your code:
It would've been better to change the order of select and filter:
SchIndxRead %>% filter(.College.Lookup == ""MIAD"") %>% select(.DormList)
This way you don't have to add the SchIndxRead$ later.
You might prefer using pull():

1025,74584881,74583306,Gilbert Le Blanc,300257,"Let's work through a simple example.
I'm not sure what -2 to 2(x) means. Let's assume a linear graph going from -2 to 2 on the X-axis and a drawing JPanel of 1000 x 800 pixels. If your graph uses a logarithmic scale then the math will be much more complicated.
Your X pixel count goes from 0 to 1000. So 0 represents -2 and 1000 represents 2.
The formula to convert values to pixels is:
pixels = (value + 2.0) X 1000 / 4.0  
or, in more general terms
pixels = (value - minimum value) X (total pixels) / (maximum value - minimum value)
The equation is the same for the Y direction unless you want to invert the Y value. Cartesian graphs have the Y axis going upward in a positive direction while a drawing JPanel has Y values increasing going downward.
If you do want to invert the Y axis, the formula is
pixels = total pixels - calculated pixels (the formula already given)",2022-11-26 19:13:00Z,0

This will not work because the out-of-class definition for the member function of a class must be in the same namespace in which the containing class is.
Thus, to solve this you can either define the class(in the header) in namespace Model1 or implement the member function(in the source file) in global namespace. Both these methods are shown below:
Method 1
Here we define the class in namespace Model1 in the header and leave the source file unchanged.

namespace Model1   //added this namepspace here

class Dialog

  <div id=""but"">

  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  height: 100%;
  width: 100%;
  position: fixed;

As you are using a div for the background, You need to keep position: fixed here. Now to center the but you can use align-self because using align-items in the container will make the children to shrink later.
#but {
  align-self: center;
}
To make all flex-container children same height lets remove all height properties since that is the default behavior of flex-box (when in row direction). And to make para and bg-text divs same width lets use flex: 1. This will make them grow to the same size as long as it has enough space.
.left.arrow {
  margin: auto 0;
  z-index: 2;
  padding: 10px;
}

.right.arrow {
  margin: auto 0;
  z-index: 2;
  padding: 10px;
}

  background-color: rgb(0, 0, 0);
  /* Fallback color */
  background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.4);
  /* Black w/opacity/see-through */
  color: white;
  font-weight: bold;

It looks like you want to center the preview_text. Lets use flex-box again.
.container {
  height: 100%;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
}

#preview_text {
  /* line-height: 500px; */
}
For now the flex-container is using full width. To limit it you can use a fixed margin or fixed width. Using percentage for this will create large margins on small screens unless you put different values for different screen sizes (using media queries or the calc and min/max functions). Let's use a fixed width and margin: auto to keep it centralized.
.flex-container {
  display: flex;

People can use context clues to determine that ""Jon"" and ""Inbar"" are objects joined to the verb ""equals"", but the Python interpreter is more literal minded.
if name == ""Kevin"" or ""Jon"" or ""Inbar"":
is logically equivalent to:
if (name == ""Kevin"") or (""Jon"") or (""Inbar""):
Which, for user Bob, is equivalent to:
if (False) or (""Jon"") or (""Inbar""):
The or operator chooses the first argument with a positive truth value:
if ""Jon"":
And since ""Jon"" has a positive truth value, the if block executes. That is what causes ""Access granted"" to be printed regardless of the name given.
All of this reasoning also applies to the expression if ""Kevin"" or ""Jon"" or ""Inbar"" == name. the first value, ""Kevin"", is true, so the if block executes.
There are two common ways to properly construct this conditional.
Use multiple == operators to explicitly check against each value:
if name == ""Kevin"" or name == ""Jon"" or name == ""Inbar"":
Compose a collection of valid values (a set, a list or a tuple for example), and use the in operator to test for membership:
if name in {""Kevin"", ""Jon"", ""Inbar""}:
In general of the two the second should be preferred as it's easier to read and also faster:
>>> import timeit
>>> timeit.timeit('name == ""Kevin"" or name == ""Jon"" or name == ""Inbar""',
    setup=""name='Inbar'"")

(And adding a few of my points)
Explanation :
if name == ""Kevin"" or ""Jon"" or ""Inbar"":
is logically equivalent to:
if (name == ""Kevin"") or (""Jon"") or (""Inbar""):
Which, for user Bob, is equivalent to:
if (False) or (""Jon"") or (""Inbar""):
NOTE : Python evaluates the logical value of any non-zero integer as True. Therefore, all Non-empty lists, sets, strings, etc. are evaluable and return True
The or operator chooses the first argument with a positive truth value.
Therefore, ""Jon"" has a positive truth value and the if block executes, since it is now equivalent to
if (False) or (True) or (True):
That is what causes ""Access granted"" to be printed regardless of the name input.
Solutions :
Solution 1 : Use multiple == operators to explicitly check against each value
if name == ""Kevin"" or name == ""Jon"" or name == ""Inbar"":
    print(""Access granted."")
else:
    print(""Access denied."")
Solution 2 : Compose a collection of valid values (a set, a list or a tuple for example), and use the in operator to test for membership (faster, preferred method)
if name in {""Kevin"", ""Jon"", ""Inbar""}:
    print(""Access granted."")
else:
    print(""Access denied."")
OR
if name in [""Kevin"", ""Jon"", ""Inbar""]:
    print(""Access granted."")
else:
    print(""Access denied."")
Solution 3 : Use the basic (and not very efficient) if-elif-else structure
if name == ""Kevin"":

elif name == ""Inbar"":

1056,65199768,20002503,mkrieger1,4621513,"Approaches
How a data scientist approaches this problem
The simplest way possible is to eliminate the need for comparison operators and use a list. This looks impressive on security systems because you learn to access ORMs.
user = input(""Enter name: "")

if user in {""Bob"", ""Kevin"", ""Joe""}:
   print(""Access granted, "" + str(user) + ""."")
else:
   print(""Access denied."")
Or, you can resemble the exact same code above, just put the list of registered users in their own list:
user = input(""Enter name: "")
users = {""Bob"", ""Kevin"", ""Joe"", ""a million more users if you like""}

if user in users:
   print(""Access granted, "" + str(user) + ""."")
else:
   print(""Access denied."")
If you wanted to complete this protocol safely without the risk of attack, set up double parameters. This would check your mini-ORM for first and last name fields, as well as a password or secret question key. Objects can be sorted like this if you want to efficiently lazy-load user credentials without hashing:
def lazy(i):
   j = 0 # For example
   while j < i:
      yield j
      j += 1
The loop will consume only the yielded values to save time and energy on your system:
You can then do something with the iterated list:
for j in lazy_range(10):
   do_something_here(j)
This problem can be approached from any angle: memory management, security, or simply by an organic list or packaged ORM.",2022-01-02 09:47:13Z,-1

You are not given the mean, but imagine a value moving up the real line, and choosing the timestamps from each sorted array that are closest to it. Your choice from any array will only change at the midpoint between two adjacent values.
An O(n) algorithm for this problem is to start with the first elements in each array, and then repeatedly advance in the array with the smallest midpoint between the current element and the next. In this way you will consider all possible sets of closest elements to any point. In python, it looks like this:

for (const auto& ms : vp)

Also why use new and delete in getItem? And why declare class variables when you should use local variables?
void getItem(char* item) {

sp doesn't need to be a pointer, and it should be a local variable.

Also I think getItem has a bug. I'm guessing that you want a new multiset every five character, but that's not what the code does. Maybe this is what you want

Indeed, something of a State a b will take a state of type a might change the state (to pass to the next State object), and might ""return"" some value of type b.
If you thus have a function helper1 :: State Int String for example, and a function helper2 :: String -> State Int () you can pass the String that will be returned by the State object of helper1 to construct a State object of helper2, so you can make a function:
func :: State Int ()
func = do
  s <- helper1
  helper2 s
Both helper1 and helper2 s can read the state that will be passed, modify the state, or might for example return the state. But nor func, helper1 and helper2 contain a state. What you can do is work with runState :: State s a -> s -> (s, a). Here you provide an initial state, and you run that state through func for example. We can thus call runState func 0 to run this ""through"" func with initial state 0.

The comparison curr!=head will always be true. You should compare the val members of the nodes, not their addresses.
So correct the relevant part like this:
    curr = reverseList(curr); // assign to `curr`
    while(curr!=NULL && head!=NULL){
        if(curr->val!=head->val) // compare `val`

1135,74583286,74583155,O. Jones,205608,"It looks like you want your numeric meta_value results to appear after the non-numeric ones.
In SQL you can simplify your ORDER BY like this.
ORDER BY (meta_value REGEXP '^[0-9]+$'), meta_value DESC
It works because the output of Boolean comparison operations appear a 1 for true and 0 for false.The parentheses aren't strictly necessary but they make the code a bit easier to read.
But, you cannot just stuff this SQL style clause into a WP_Query() object. Replacing the ORDER BY clause is tricky.
Start by converting this into a WP_Query operation. Those things don't look a whole lot like pure SQL. You need something like this, not debugged.
$q = new WP_Query ( 
   ['meta_key' => 'price',
    'order'    => 'DESC',
    'orderby'  => 'meta_value_num',
   ]);
Then you'll get your posts in numeric order by price, with oddball results for non-numeric prices. Run this query and convince yourself you get the posts you want, even if not in the perfect order.
Only then, put a filter handler on the posts_orderby filter to put in your SQLish custom ordering clause. The post you referenced shows how to do that: WordPress Query: ORDER BY CASE WHEN
Use John Blackbourn's Query Monitor plugin to see what your query looks like in real life, after all the WP_Query code finishes assembling it. The correct use of query filters can sometimes be confusing.
If code is poetry then the WP_Query code is an occult spell invocation chant. Sigh.",2022-11-26 15:47:34Z,0

I would however advise to use a ModelForm, this makes saving the data easier and less error-prone, but will also do proper validation: for example checking that time is indeed passed, and that it is formatted as a correct datetime string.
Note: normally a Django model is given a singular name, so Course instead of Courses.
Note: Normally model fields have no prefix with the name of the model. This makes queries longer to read, and often want uses inheritance of (abstract) models to inherit fields, so using a prefix would make it less reusable. Therefore it might be better to rename your field course_name to name.",2022-11-26 19:47:34Z,0
